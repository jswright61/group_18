What is SlideScape?

SlideScape is a fun and interactive game specifically designed to engage minds with an intriguing sliding number puzzle with a twist of urgency due to the included timer. Slide Scape was created by "Group 18" as a Programming Problem Solving project at Kennesaw State University. [Group 18 includes: Ernie Fichtel, Scott Wright, Oneeb Kahn, Jonathan Parson, and Sequoya Jackson]


How to Play:

The object of the game is to slide each number tile one-by-one to put them in ascending order from left to right and top to bottom. When a tile with an empty space next to it is clicked, the tile will then move into that empty space. The user must maneuver these tiles skillfully until the tiles are in the correct ascending order starting from the lowest number at the top left corner to the largest number at the bottom right.
